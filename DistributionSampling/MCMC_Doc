This document lists the MCMC code brought over from MCMC_CC
as well as some of what was done with said code.

Classes Brought Over:
1. MCMCConfiguration (Pre-John's changes) -> MultiModel and sub models
   -- MultiModel provides a method for reading in a configuration for the model.
   -- Sub models provide ways to calculate the model outputs, the likelihood,
      and the prior. 
2. MCMCRun
   -- Configuration of how the trace is handled was moved to the
      Trace class.
   -- Removed the Run function.
   -- Created a NextSample function.
   -- Removed the Trace object so that it is external.
3. Distribution
4. LikelihoodDistribution (RHIC, RHIC_PCA, Cosmo, Test)
   -- Emulation -> sub models
   -- Changed Evaluate to take model ouputs
   -- Inter has no distribution since loglike comes directly from
      the emulator. Thus the Interpolator distribution in MCMC_CC
      was put into InterModel.
5. PriorDistribution (RHIC, RHIC_PCA, Cosmo, Test, Inter)
6. ProposalDistribution (Functionality put into MCMCRun)
7. VizHandler (Unnecessary)
8. Quad was brought over as it is the emulator handler for RHIC_PCA

Classes Not Brought Over:
1. ParameterSet (Replaced with TraceElement)
2. ParameterSetList (Replaced with Trace)
   -- Put functionality of ParameterSet and ParameterSetList
      into Trace and TraceElement (For the most part)
